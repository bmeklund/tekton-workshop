== Timing and schedule

=== Full workshop (2 - 2.5 hours)

* **Module 1**: Tekton fundamentals (30 minutes)
* **Module 2**: Creating Tasks and TaskRuns (35 minutes)
* **Module 3**: Building your first pipeline (35 minutes)
* **Module 4**: Monitoring and troubleshooting (20 minutes)
* **Module 5**: Pipeline as code (30 minutes)

=== Abbreviated workshop (1 hour)

* **Module 1**: Tekton fundamentals (30 minutes)
* **Module 2**: Creating Tasks and TaskRuns (30 minutes, abbreviated)

== Technical requirements

=== Software versions

* Red Hat OpenShift {ocp_version}
* Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines {pipelines_version}
* OpenShift CLI (`oc`) version 4.20
* Tekton CLI (`tkn`) version 0.38 or later
* Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

=== Environment access

Participants need access to:

* OpenShift {ocp_version} multinode cluster (provided in the lab)
* Gitea Git server (provided in the lab)
* Web terminal accessible from the right panel in Showroom

=== Network requirements

* Internet connectivity is not required for this lab
* All required images and resources are pre-deployed in your lab environment
* OpenShift console URL: {openshift_console_url}
* Gitea server URL: {gitea_console_url}

== Environment setup

=== Pre-workshop checklist

Before starting, verify the following:

* OpenShift console is accessible at `{openshift_console_url}`
* You can log in with username `{user}` and password `{password}`
* Gitea is accessible at `{gitea_console_url}`
* The web terminal in the right panel responds to commands

=== Setup validation

Run these commands in the terminal tab on the right to verify your environment is ready:

[source,bash]
----
# Verify you are logged in to OpenShift
oc whoami

# Verify OpenShift CLI version
oc version --client

# Verify Tekton CLI version
tkn version

# Verify OpenShift Pipelines operator is installed
oc get csv -n openshift-operators | grep pipelines
----

Expected output:

----
system:serviceaccount:...  (or your username)

Client Version: 4.20.x

Client version: 0.38.x
...

openshift-pipelines-operator-rh.v1.20.x   Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines   1.20.x   ...   Succeeded
----

== Troubleshooting guide

=== Common setup issues

**Problem**: "Error from server (Forbidden)"

**Solution**: Verify your username and project context:

[source,bash]
----
oc whoami
oc project
----

**Problem**: "Unable to connect to the server"

**Solution**: Confirm you are logged in to the correct cluster:

[source,bash]
----
oc login {openshift_console_url} -u {user} -p {password}
----

NOTE: Replace `{openshift_console_url}` with the API server URL if the console URL does not work for CLI login. The API URL typically uses port 6443.

**Problem**: "`tkn` command not found"

**Solution**: Use the web terminal in the right panel. It has all required tools pre-installed. Alternatively, install the Tekton CLI using:

[source,bash]
----
# Download tkn binary from OpenShift mirror
oc image extract registry.redhat.io/openshift-pipelines/pipelines-cli-tkn-rhel8:latest \
  --path=/usr/bin/tkn:/usr/local/bin/ \
  --confirm
----

**Problem**: "Pipelines operator status shows `Installing`"

**Solution**: Wait 2 to 3 minutes for the operator to finish installing. Refresh the Installed Operators page in the console.

=== During workshop support

* Encourage participants to help each other
* The terminal in the right panel has all required tools pre-installed
* If a pipeline fails unexpectedly, check the pod logs using `oc describe pod` for detailed error messages
