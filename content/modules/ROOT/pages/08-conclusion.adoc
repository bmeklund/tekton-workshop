Congratulations! You have completed the Building Pipelines using Tekton on OpenShift workshop.

Coolstuff Store came in with manual deployments, slow release cycles, and no visibility into build status. You've left them with a fully automated CI/CD system: reusable Tasks, an end-to-end Pipeline pulling from a Git repository, monitoring tools for diagnosing failures, and Pipelines as Code automatically triggering runs on every push -- all without manual cluster intervention.

== What you've learned

Throughout this workshop, you gained hands-on experience with:

* How Tekton Tasks encapsulate reusable CI/CD steps and execute as Kubernetes pods, with TaskRuns providing each execution record
* How multiple steps within a Task run sequentially and share data through a Workspace, with Parameters making the same Task reusable across applications and versions
* How Pipelines chain Tasks using `runAfter` without tightly coupling them, with Pipeline Parameters and Workspace mappings flowing values down to each stage
* How the OpenShift console visual pipeline graph and the `tkn` CLI give operators and developers instant visibility into pipeline status at every stage
* How to diagnose failed pipeline runs using `tkn pipelinerun describe` and step-level logs, and how to recover by fixing the underlying cause and re-running
* How Pipelines as Code stores pipeline definitions in the `.tekton/` directory alongside application code, triggers runs automatically on Git events, and gives developers GitOps PR commands to control execution without touching the cluster

You now have the skills to design, build, run, and maintain CI/CD pipelines on Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines for any application.

== Key takeaways

The most important concepts to carry forward:

. **Tasks are the atomic unit** -- A Task defines what to do; a TaskRun executes it. Parameters make Tasks reusable; Workspaces let steps share data. Design Tasks to do 1 thing well and they become building blocks for any pipeline.

. **Pipelines orchestrate without coupling** -- `runAfter` defines execution order without creating direct dependencies between Task definitions. The same Task can appear in multiple Pipelines, and changing 1 Task does not require updating all the Pipelines that use it.

. **The diagnostic pattern is consistent** -- Whether a TaskRun or a PipelineRun fails, the workflow is the same: `list` to find the failure, `describe` to identify which task and why, `logs` to read the step-level output. This pattern applies to every Tekton resource.

. **Storage is separate from logic** -- Workspaces declared on Tasks and Pipelines are bound to actual storage at runtime by TaskRuns and PipelineRuns. The same Task works with a PVC in staging and an `emptyDir` in a quick CI run. Never hardcode storage into Task definitions.

. **Pipelines as Code closes the loop** -- Storing `.tekton/` templates in Git makes CI/CD changes reviewable, versionable, and auditable. Webhook-triggered runs and GitOps commands (`/retest`, `/cancel`) mean developers interact with CI/CD entirely within their Git workflow.

== Next steps

=== Recommended topics to explore

Build on what you've learned with these related areas:

* **OpenShift GitOps with Argo CD** -- Pair your CI pipeline with a GitOps-based CD workflow that automatically syncs Kubernetes resources from Git to the cluster. CI builds the artifact; Argo CD deploys it.
* **Container image builds with Buildah** -- Extend your pipeline with a build stage that uses the Buildah ClusterTask (or link:https://hub.tekton.dev/tekton/task/buildah[Tekton Hub `buildah` Task^]) to build and push a container image to a registry.
* **OpenShift Pipelines Triggers** -- Before Pipelines as Code, Tekton Triggers handled webhook-to-PipelineRun conversion. Understanding Triggers helps when reading existing cluster configurations and when PAC is not available.
* **Secure software supply chain with Tekton Chains** -- Automatically sign pipeline artifacts and generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) entries for every build. Built into Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines.

=== Practice projects

Put your new skills to work with these hands-on projects:

. **Add a container image build stage** -- Extend the `coolstuff-build-pipeline` from Module 3 with a fourth Task that builds a container image using Buildah and pushes it to the OpenShift internal registry. Use a Workspace to pass the cloned source from `clone-source` through to the build stage.

. **Add a deploy stage** -- Create a `deploy-app` Task that runs `oc rollout restart deployment/coolstuff-app` after a successful image build. Chain it as the final stage in the pipeline so a passing build automatically updates the running application.

. **Create a pull request pipeline** -- Add a second file to `.tekton/`, named `pr-pipeline.yaml`, that triggers only on `pull_request` events and runs only the validate and test stages (skipping package and deploy). This gives developers fast feedback on pull requests without triggering a full deployment.

. **Add pipeline notifications** -- Create a `notify-slack` or `notify-email` Task that runs in the `finally` clause of a Pipeline to report the pipeline result, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. Tekton's `finally` tasks always run even when the pipeline fails.
